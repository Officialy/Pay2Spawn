/**
 * I'm insane for doing this but oh well.
 * <p/>
 * Use case: You want the same random value in 2 or more places.
 * You need to use the full expression everywhere.
 * The first time the solver comes across the tag with a new name, it will solve the random.
 * The second (or more) time if just fills in the value from memory.
 * <p/>
 * How to use: $var(name, somerandomthing)
 * <p/>
 * Example: $var(1, random(1, 10))
